					HOMEWORK 1

My algorithm is as follows:
1)	The user selects ‘X’ or ‘O’. If user selects X, will be the first one to start else computer will play first. 
2)	If computer plays first, it either plays its move in the center or in the corner randomly.
3)	If user plays first move other than the center then computer plays in the center or else in any of the corner.
4)	If computer can win from a move, it plays that move
5)	If the user can win from his next move, computer blocks that move
6)	If computer can make a move that will lay the foundation for a fork, it plays that move.
7)	If the user tries to set up the fork from next move, computer plays the move on one of the users winning combination to avoid forking.
